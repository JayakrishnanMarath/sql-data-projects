Project Title:
Player Behavior and Reward Distribution in PlayGrid Gaming Platform

Overview:
PlayGrid is a real-money online gaming company offering multiplayer games such as Ludo. 
Users can register as players, deposit money onto the platform, and participate in real-time games against other players. 
Winners can withdraw their earnings while the platform charges a nominal service fee.
To encourage retention and sustained engagement, PlayGrid allocates loyalty rewards to players based on their activity, 
including games played, deposits made, and withdrawal behavior. T
his project explores how player actions translate into reward points and how those points are distributed fairly.

Objective:
Analyze and assess player engagement, transaction behavior, and game activity to determine:
Player-wise performance during defined time slots in October.
Fair distribution of a ₹50,000 bonus among the top 50 performers.
The effectiveness and fairness of the loyalty point formula used by PlayGrid.

Loyalty Point Formula Used:
Loyalty Points = 
(0.01 × Total Deposits) + 
(0.005 × Total Withdrawals) + 
(0.001 × MAX(Deposits – Withdrawals, 0)) + 
(0.2 × Number of Games Played)


Slot-Based Loyalty Points
S1: 12:00 AM to 11:59 AM
S2: 12:00 PM to 11:59 PM

Part- A

1: Loyalty points were calculated separately for these slots:

a: 2nd October – Slot S1
b: 16th October – Slot S2
c: 18th October – Slot S1
d: 26th October – Slot S2

Monthly Ranking
1: All players were ranked based on total loyalty points earned in October. In case of a tie, the number of games played was used as the secondary ranking factor.
2: Other Metrics Calculated
3: Average deposit amount across all players
4: Average deposit amount per user in October
5: Average number of games played per user

Part B – Bonus Distribution

PlayGrid allocated a ₹50,000 bonus pool to reward its top 50 players for the month.
Key Questions Addressed:

Should the bonus be distributed solely based on loyalty points?
Should other metrics (like number of games played or deposit-to-profit ratio) be considered?
How can we ensure fairness and proportional distribution?
A weighted model was proposed to allocate bonuses proportionally based on each top player’s contribution (e.g., loyalty points or performance ratio) to the group total.

Part C – Formula Evaluation

The final section assessed whether the existing loyalty point formula is:
Fair to all types of players (high depositors, high gamers, or balanced users)
Scalable and adaptable for edge cases (e.g., users depositing large sums but playing few games)
Recommendations were provided to make the formula more balanced — such as setting caps, introducing dynamic weights, or linking bonus payout more directly to player profit or engagement metrics.
