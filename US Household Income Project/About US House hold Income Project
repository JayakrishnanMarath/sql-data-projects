U.S. Household Income Analysis Using SQL: Cleaning, Standardization & EDA

Overview:
Developed a complete SQL workflow to clean, standardize, and analyze real-world U.S. household income data. The project focused on improving data quality and extracting insights for socioeconomic analysis.

Steps Taken:

1. Data Cleaning:

Removed duplicates using unique IDs

Addressed missing/zero values in key fields (Place, ALand, AWater)

Verified data integrity across geographical columns

2. Data Standardization:

Corrected typos (e.g., "georia" â†’ "Georgia")

Standardized state/type classifications

Fixed inconsistent location names

3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Computed summary stats at state, type, and city levels

Ranked regions by average household income

Analyzed total land and water area by state

Use Cases:

Data cleaning and transformation practice

EDA for income-based regional comparisons

Foundation for visualization or ML applications

Tools:
SQL, real-world U.S. household income datasets
