This document is a SQL script for data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset called world_life_expectancy. It contains SQL queries and comments that:

Clean the Data:

Remove duplicate rows based on country and year.
Fill in missing values for the "Status" column (e.g., Developed/Developing) using data from other years for the same country.
Fill in missing values for the "Life expectancy" column by averaging the values from the previous and next years for that country.
Analyze the Data (EDA):

Calculate the increase in life expectancy for each country over 15 years.
Find average life expectancy by year.
Explore the relationship between GDP and life expectancy.
Compare life expectancy between developed and developing countries.
Analyze the relationship between BMI and life expectancy by country.
Investigate adult mortality trends using rolling totals.
The script uses advanced SQL techniques (like window functions and subqueries) and is structured to both clean the data and extract meaningful insights from it.
